# ðŸŒ± Why GrowHardware is Different

### âœ¨ Fractal Architecture

From a standalone ESP32-CAM to a network orchestrated by Raspberry Pi. Each node is autonomous and scalable.

### ðŸ§  Medullas

A technical abstract language that translates cultivation variables: water, light, air, temperature, humidity.

### ðŸ’¡ Practical Modularity

Fractal design for indoor setups, greenhouses, and rural networks. Local or federated control with distributed backend.

### ðŸ¤– Augmented Intelligence

AI layer with TensorFlow: detection, prediction, and improvement of the productive environment using real data.

### ðŸš€ Key Differentiators

* Low cost, high adaptability
* Scalable and open
* Integrated AI
* Free philosophy for real-world growers
